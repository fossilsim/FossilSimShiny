* bug in reconstructed tree w/taxonomy - filed on the FossilSim repo

Feature requests (feedback from Morlon team 13/12/2023)
- add appearance option to show the rates for the time-dependent / environment-dependent 
- random name generator for species ? 
- simulate traits and plot them on the tree => biogeography ? + transition points within edges
- colours are ugly (says Jérémy) => option to choose colours possible ?
- colour ranges are too thin when tree is big (25 tips + turnover 0.8)
- time-dependent rates - add dropdown for different distro options ?
- add better description of depth-dependent model (could do a "help" popup for more details on the models ?)
- appearance buttons should not trigger automatic changes to the view - either explicit changes OR remove altogether
- views menu might be better as radio buttons than dropdown

Reviewer comments 
- add buttons to clear fossils or taxonomy without restarting the whole thing => should be doable
- do a better job of linking plot options to the selected plot / simulated data => to discuss - unfortunately, may need a rewrite of the architecture for that (aka porting plot options to the other side of the UI // or just getting rid of the whole separation altogether erk)
- add timer for simulations => should be doable
- add counts for simulations - # of fossils, # of events of each type (budding, anagenetic etc) => should be doable
- default lineage-dependent settings often break, better defaults needed => Fix that before sending back
- error messages to add on top of the plot not instead of the plot => should be doable (?)
- timescale & sampling depth too light, font too small => Fix that before sending back
- taxonomy colours change everytime the plot is reloaded => to discuss, I think this is an issue from FossilSim
- filename for saving not specific enough => Fix that before sending back
- save image button breaks when no plot exists => Fix that before sending back
- sampling depth chart overlaps with tooltip area => to discuss, I think we need to reevaluate how the tooltip area works because atm it gives different results based on screen size and other details, probably need to make it a separate area in the R code but not sure how this would work with the javascript
- dark mode doesn't work for changing the colour of the plot area => May need to get Titouan to help on that one
- more control over time intervals would be nice => to discuss what makes sense for the app
- change tip limit when app is run locally vs on a server => to discuss, I think auto-detection is tricky but we could use a config file to specify limits (thus the user could change them if they want), I need to look further into this
see https://forum.posit.co/t/is-there-a-way-to-detect-if-an-app-is-running-on-shinyapps-io/20666 for autodetection (shinyapps only though)
