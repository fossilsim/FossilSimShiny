* bug in reconstructed tree w/taxonomy - filed on the FossilSim repo

Feature requests (feedback from Morlon team 13/12/2023)
- add appearance option to show the rates for the time-dependent / environment-dependent 
- random name generator for species ? 
- simulate traits and plot them on the tree => biogeography ? + transition points within edges
- colours are ugly (says Jérémy) => option to choose colours possible ?
- colour ranges are too thin when tree is big (25 tips + turnover 0.8)
- time-dependent rates - add dropdown for different distro options ?
- add better description of depth-dependent model (could do a "help" popup for more details on the models ?)
- appearance buttons should not trigger automatic changes to the view - either explicit changes OR remove altogether
- views menu might be better as radio buttons than dropdown
