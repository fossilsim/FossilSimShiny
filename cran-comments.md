## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Converted the DESCRIPTION title to title case.

* Changed the urls in the documentation to canonical form.

* Note : the link `http:// your ip address :3838/FossilSimShiny/` in `vignettes/hosting.Rmd` is used for instructional purposes, it is not meant to be a valid address. The user is supposed to replace `your ip address` with his server's ip address.

## Test environments

* local Debian 11 install, R 4.2.0

* local Windows 10 install, R 4.2.0

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note
