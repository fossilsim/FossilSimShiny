## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Wrote package names in single quotes in title and description.

* added missing Rd tags and an example to `launchFossilSimShiny.Rd`

* Note : the link `http:// your ip address :3838/FossilSimShiny/` in `vignettes/hosting.Rmd` is used for instructional purposes, it is not meant to be a valid address. The user is supposed to replace `your ip address` with his server's ip address.

## Test environments

* local Debian 11 install, R 4.2.0

* local Windows 10 install, R 4.2.0

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note
